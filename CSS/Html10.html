					<p class="news-p">It was only a matter of time before Conor McGregor commented on the outcome of the UFC 280 main event after Islam Makhachev defeated Charles Oliveira to become the new lightweight champion.</p>
					<P class="news-p">While he’s teased a return to action as a welterweight, the Irish superstar has a long-standing grudge against Makhachev’s team — primarily his head coach Khabib Nurmagomedov — after they engaged in a volatile rivalry before finally meeting in 2018.</P>
					<p class="news-p">McGregor was complimentary towards Makhachev’s performance after the lightweight title challenger tapped out Oliveira with an arm-triangle choke in the second round. But he quickly shifted gears to detail all the reasons why he would vanquish the Russian should they ever meet.</p>
